            <div>Zen Med Rentals - is a medical equipment rental services designed to help hospitals and healthcare facilities meet short-term and long-term equipment needs.</div>
            <div className="down-1 xs-down-2">This ALX Foundation Project, Zen Med Rental was inspired by the high cost of purchasing medical equipment in Nigeria. The upfront cost of these equipment can be prohibitive for many healthcare facilities, especially those in rural areas. As a result, many patients have to travel long distances to access the care they need, or they go without care altogether.</div>
            <div className="down-1 xs-down-2">Zen Med Rental provides a more affordable and accessible option for healthcare facilities to obtain the medical equipment they need. The company rents a wide range of equipment, including ventilators, defibrillators, and operating tables. Zen Med Rental also offers delivery and installation services, as well as maintenance and repair services.</div>
